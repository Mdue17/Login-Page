**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This beautiful responsive client side ui is made by html css and js. It shows how i can help users have a page wher they can sign up if they are new or help regular users sign up.It makes options like signing up with social platforms available, which most users love because its easy and fast.

## Still to be done:

* the page still needs to store data in a database so that users can stay logged in
* have a random password generator


## Lessons Learned:

* i learnt a lot about some CSS features which include transitioning and transforming.These produced styles that makes the page vibrant and lively
